Python itself provides several built-in functions (e.g. `print`, `len()`, `range()`), whilst user-defined functions can also be constructed and utilized. In a general sense, functions take some *input* and return some *output* in accordance to the functionality to which the function is defined.\n",

Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses, which can be default (mandatory) or non-default (optional). The code block within every function starts with a colon ( `:` ) and is indented. The statement `return` [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller.

In order to download from NGA West2 database, the user must have an account on: https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/. If you do not know what the package containts and if there are no documentation you can use help() to see *Docstring*. Likewise, dir() function can be used to get attributes of given object Moreover you can use shortcuts given that you using jupyter notebook.
